# wruby

**wruby is a single file, minimal site generator written in Ruby.** (*Not* the ruby gem)

The "w" is silent...

## Features

* Fast, OS-agnostic site generator
* Auto-generated, valid [RSS feed](/index.rss)
* Custom `header.html` and `footer.html` templates
* Not much else (this is a *good* thing!)

You can learn more by reading [the official README](https://git.btxx.org/wruby/about).
