# About

wruby is a minimal blog generator written in Ruby.

## Why?

This project was created by me, [Bradley Taunt](https://btxx.org), out of frustration with overly complex and bloated blogging options. I tried so many "minimal" generators but each one ended up having some glaring issue or heavy reliance on dependencies.

Originally, I solved this problem by creating [barf](https://barf.btxx.org) - a blog generator pieced together with basic shell scripting. While this project works well, I prefer to write with Ruby since it is such a beautiful language.

So, wruby was born. There isn't much else to say. I hope you enjoy using it and
be sure to report any issues if you come arcoss any bugs!
